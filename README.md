# Word-Search-Puzzle-Game
A Word Search Puzzle consists of a grid of letters, with words hidden inside horizontally,
vertically and diagonally. The playerâ€™s task is to find all the words hidden in the grid.
This project creates a Word Search Puzzle generator, and a program that
lets the user play the game against the clock.
The user is asked to pick a category from a list, create a word search puzzle
based on that category and then let them type words they can see in the grid. If they find all
words before a timer reaches zero, they win!
